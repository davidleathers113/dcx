# Dependable Call Exchange (DCX)

This repository contains the full-stack application for the Dependable Call Exchange, a type-safe, observable, and economically-aware call routing platform.

## Project Structure

This project is a monorepo containing three primary packages:

-   `/backend`: A Node.js, Express, and Prisma application that serves the main API.
-   `/frontend`: A Next.js and Shadcn UI application for the admin dashboard.
-   `/openapi`: Contains the shared OpenAPI 3.1 specification that defines the contract between the backend and frontend.

### Getting Started

To run the full application, you will need to set up and run both the `backend` and `frontend` projects. Please refer to the `README.md` file inside each of those directories for specific instructions.
